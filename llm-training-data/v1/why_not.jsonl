Because you excluded the highest energy level, this conflicts with the breed’s typical needs and rules it out. Your other preferences fit, but the energy requirement is the deciding factor. Consider a moderately active herding breed if you like similar traits with lower intensity."}]}

While they can fit apartment life, the saliva management and skin-fold care may not match your goals. If drool is a strong preference, consider lower-drooling companion breeds with similar easygoing temperaments."}]}
