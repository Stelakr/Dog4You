{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why did you suggest Golden Retriever for me? My answers: energyLevel=4, goodWithKids=5, trainability=5, shedding=2 dealbreaker accept"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Golden Retrievers are heavy shedders so due to your dealbreaker they are excluded from your list. Other than that Golden Retrievers suite your preferrences - they are family friendly dogs that learn quickly and enjoy activities, they're highly affectionate, easy to train and they thrive with regular excercise - all of the things you prefer. Since you put a dealbreaker for shedding you shouldn't get a Golden Retriever if you're not ready to deal with hair everywhere. "}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why did you suggest Barbado da Terceira for me? My answers: trainability=5, protectiveNature=5, barkingLevel=1, shedding=1, opennessToStrangers=4"},{"role":"assistant","content":"The Barbado da Terceira is a medium-sized herding dog. Due to their intelligence, agility, strong work ethic and trainability they make a great match for you. Barbados are great protective dogs that are not as loud or vocal which suits your preferences perfectly, they are very eager to learn and barely shed. Only missmatch is that they are not as open to strangers as you'd want your ideal match to be. If that is something critical for you consider other breeds with a more social default."}]}
