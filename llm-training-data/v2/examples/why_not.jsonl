I chose: goodWithOtherDogs=5, opennessToStrangers=4, protectiveNature=2"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Akitas can be reserved with strangers and selective with other dogs. Your profile prefers very social behavior and low protectiveness, so friendlier, more easygoing breeds ranked higher. Akitas can give a hard time to a first time owner."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why not explanation expectedBreed:Basset Hound? Answers: energyLevel=4–5 barkingLevel=1, grooming=low"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Bassets are generally lower energy and can be vocal alerters. While grooming is easy because of their smooth and short hair, they still need frequent brushing. The energy and quiet profile you want in your ideal ddog doesn’t align as closely, so sportier, quieter options moved ahead."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why not explanation: expectedBreed:Basenji, answers:trainability=5, goodWithKids=5, energyLevel=3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Basenjis can be independent so they can be harder to train and aren’t universally ideal for families with young kids. They are energetic, highly intelligent and prone to mischief which doesn't allign as well with your preferred energy level."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn't Afhgan Hound a top match, answers: trainability=1 dealbreaker exclude, energyLevel=4, opennesToStrangers=3"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Afghan Hound was excluded from your list since you put a dealbreaker for low trainability dogs. Their high energy level and mild opennes to strangers match your preferrences but they are independant and aloof which makes training harder and a bad match for you."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why not explanation: expectedBreed=Border Collie, answers=energyLevel:5 excluded (dealbreaker), coatType:double accepted, livingEnvironment:suburban flexible."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Border Collies are typically very high energy. Because you excluded the highest energy level, this conflicts with the breed’s typical needs and rules it out. Your other preferences fit, but the energy requirement is the deciding factor. Consider a moderately active herding breed if you like similar traits with lower intensity."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn’t Afghan Hound a top match? I chose: opennessToStrangers=5, trainability=5, groomingFrequency=low, barkingLevel=1."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Afghan Hounds are reserved with strangers and can be independent to train, so they don’t meet your very friendly and very biddable profile. Grooming needs are also high, not low. Their low barking tendency fits, but other priorities pulled the match down."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn’t Basenji a top match? I chose: barkingLevel=4, trainability=5, goodWithKids=5."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Basenjis are typically very quiet and independent. If you want a more vocal alert dog with top-tier biddability and a consistently kid-centric temperament, other breeds align better."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn’t American Bulldog a top match? I chose: energyLevel=2, livingEnvironment=apartment, droolingLevel=1."},{"role":"assistant","content":"American Bulldogs are athletic and thrive with higher daily exercise and space. Many drool more than minimal. For low energy in an apartment, calmer, lower-drool breeds ranked higher."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn’t Akita a top match? I chose: goodWithOtherDogs=5, opennessToStrangers=5, protectiveNature=2."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Akitas tend to be selective with other dogs, reserved with unfamiliar people, and naturally protective. Your preferences lean toward very social, low-guarding dogs, so friendlier breeds took the lead."}]}

I chose: energyLevel=1, groomingFrequency=very low, barkingLevel=1."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Airedales are active, benefit from regular mental and physical work, and need scheduled grooming for their wiry coat. If you want very low energy and minimal grooming, calmer low-maintenance breeds are a closer fit."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn’t Akita a top match? My answers: goodWithOtherDogs=5 (dealbreaker accept), opennessToStrangers=4, protectiveNature=2."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your dealbreaker requires very dog-social behavior. Akitas are often selective with other dogs, so they were excluded to honor your dealbreaker. Openness and low guarding also don’t align strongly with typical Akita traits."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn’t Basenji a top match? My answers: barkingLevel=4 (dealbreaker accept), trainability=5, goodWithKids=4."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your dealbreaker asks for a vocal dog. Basenjis are famously quiet, so they were excluded. High trainability also isn’t a strong Basenji trait, further lowering the fit."}]}

My answers: protectiveNature=1–2 (dealbreaker accept), energyLevel=2, livingEnvironment=apartment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your dealbreaker requires low protectiveness.

{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn’t Airedale Terrier a top match? My answers: barkingLevel=1 (dealbreaker accept), groomingFrequency=very low, energyLevel=2."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your dealbreaker requires a very quiet dog. Airedales can be alert and vocal at times, so they were excluded. They also need regular coat care and more activity than you prefer."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn’t Afghan Hound a top match? My answers: trainability=5 (dealbreaker accept), groomingFrequency=low, opennessToStrangers=5."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Your dealbreaker requires very high trainability. Afghan Hounds are independent and not typically rated that high for biddability, so they were excluded. Their grooming demands also exceed your low-maintenance preference."}]}
