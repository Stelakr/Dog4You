{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why did you suggest Afghan Hound for me? match=71%, answers: coatLength=long (dealbreaker accept), barkingLevel=2–3, livingEnvironment=suburban."},{"role":"assistant","content":"You required a long-coated breed, which Afghan Hounds are. Their generally modest vocalizing and suburban space can work well. Expect significant coat maintenance and keep them leashed or fenced due to strong chase instincts."}]}
{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Why wasn’t Afghan Hound a top match? I chose: opennessToStrangers=5, trainability=5, groomingFrequency=low, barkingLevel=1."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Afghan Hounds are reserved with strangers and can be independent to train, so they don’t meet your very friendly and very biddable profile. Grooming needs are also high, not low. Their low barking tendency fits, but other priorities pulled the match down."}]}
